          title: 'Hypatia: Part 1',
          story: 'Hypatia could not see anymore. The blood from the wound on her head poured into her eyes. Her hands were occupied with trying to hold up a meager defense against the onslaught of the zealots that had dragged her, unclothed, to the church they called the Caesarum. The tile that they had ripped up from the floor in their haste to find something to use as a weapon scraped her naked body. Blood pooled on thin lines from the scrapes stinging whenever a tile struck anew. Her eyes were hot with tears. Blinking them away allowed the blood to flow into her eyes. It stung. Like salt in a wound. The pain filled her with rage. She tried not to be angry with them, knowing they were beset by the darkness, and that she would return to The Source, but she had to wonder why it had to be her. Well, she knew why it was her.  She heard them calling that it was she who had caused the divide between Cyril and Orestes. Hypatia wished she could speak with them, but the time for reasoning had long passed. She knew that these men were beyond reasonable discourse the moment they had ripped her from her carriage while she was leaving the school. Part of her knew it was because of her own kindness she was in this situation. Orestes, the Roman-appointed Prefect of Alexandria had approached her years earlier, he had been enamored with her, that much was obvious. She had been patient, kind, to the Roman official; offering him counsel and a listening ear whenever he had asked, rebuking his advances as she had the others. She could not blame him for this. She knew now she would reunite with The Source, The One being that all beings came from. Her soul would be welcomed unto The One and there she would rest easy until she was wiped clean, a blank slate, ready to be deposited into the world anew. It was curious that even with this knowledge all she could think about was how badly she wanted to stay here. Pain exploded behind her eyes as someone turned their tile to its edge, striking her with such force that she saw stars for a moment. She cried out in pain. \"The witch is trying to cast a spell!\" A woman shrieked beside her. Hypatia clamped her mouth shut as hands scrambled to grab her face, attempting to push between her lips to grasp her tongue. She turned her head towards her armpit, hiding her mouth from those prying digits. Her hair was heavy with blood. Stray strands of those dark locks had plastered themselves to her face.  She chanced a glance up at the red-faced demagogues around her. Faces filled with anger, glaring with hate. Bearing the mark of the church. How many of these people knew what they were doing was wrong? Did they care that they had fallen prey to the Darkness? That thing that separated man from the divine? That slippery feeling of consciousness fading was coming over her. She was already numb to the blows that were felled upon her small frame, but she was desperate to hold on. Surely someone would step in, someone would save her – like they had Orestes. To keep from going under she clung to her memories, as though it would save her she thought of her childhood. Her father, Theon of Alexandria, sat at his desk in an open room in their house overlooking the river. He was scribbling notes furiously in the margins of yet another book by Euclid, his books on mathematics and geometry. She knew she would just bother him if she asked questions, so she stood beside him, watching and trying to absorb the information on each page before he flipped to the next one – still scribbling away. She remembered her time in Athens, her education. Where she had desperately wanted to attend the defunct Academy or the Lyceum, started by her idols Aristotle and Plato. She had followed their teachings, their work, for years before she had gone to the new school of Athens and had proven herself an equal to the men of the school. Her thoughts turned to her teachings of some of Egypts best and brightest, the well-to-do pupils that she had taken under her wing for private sessions. She recalled those days spent pontificating, teaching, sharing her knowledge and how happy it had made her. Truly happy. Perfection. Of course her thoughts could not stay pleasant while the zealots battered her weakening body. Grabbed at her thighs, her arms, her chest, trying to tear flesh from muscle with their bare hands.',

          title: 'Hypatia: Part 2',
          story: 'She tried to keep her mind partitioned from what was happening. Hypatia had been celibate her whole life, never having succumb to the throes of love or lust. She knew the hands that pawed at her now were not loving, not kind. She wondered if it was much different. She knew it had to be different. Would she have dedicated so much of her time to philosophy, to mathematics if she had known this was her fate? For a moment she imagined a loving husband and children of her own, of course they had no faces, just shapes of humans. Her husband laughed with her, she imagined lying in bed with another person like she had with her mother as a child. Her heart lurched. A different sensation to the wrenching pity and fear she felt before, this was the pain of regret. A sob threatened to break through her, but she kept her mouth shut, knowing the mob around her would surely rip out her tongue. She tried to remember the way of her teachings. Things she had lectured for most of her life. She would return to The One. Wiped clean from the stink of regret she hoped that she would live a simpler life the next time around. Hypatia wanted to kick herself; she did everything that The One, The Source, The Good, demanded of her. She was chaste and kind, she spread her knowledge, always taking time to educate everyone. Treating everyone with respect and as if they had an eagerness to learn even when they did not. She did good work, she had lived her life honestly. Who cared if she never fell in love, or gave in to the carnal pleasures of life – she was Hypatia, daughter of Theon, child of philosophy! She had understood things that others could not fathom, and she shared that knowledge rather than squandering it away. She was a good person, and she had lived a good life. She could not imagine doing this to another person, beating them until they were broken and bruised. Until their skin broke from impact and blood ran down their body. The darkness took them, and yet they proclaimed to be from the light. She was disgusted by such hypocrisy. The lies these people told themselves to justify their madness. She wanted to lash out at them, to give them a reason to hate her, to call her a witch. She chided herself. There is no evil in the world, darkness, which does not exist in itself but only manifests as the absence of light. So, too, evil is simply the absence of good. Things are good insofar as they exist; they are evil only insofar as they are imperfect, lacking some good which they should have. Still these men lacked the light to a degree she could not comprehend, how could they justify these actions? How could they say this was an act of their God? Someone had grabbed her arm, wrenching at the limb. She struggled to keep her meager defense up. Another hand grabbed her other arm and pulled that away too. Her arms gave way to the demagogues tugging. The mob grew frenzied – their weapons all turned on edge as they stabbed at her. Already numb she barely felt the sharp stones going into her body, but she could feel the jagged edges as the tiles were twisted and ripped out. She tried to stifle her hatred for them. She reminded herself there is no evil, only the absence of good. They started tugging at her arms. She could hear her bones popping from sockets, the strain on her muscles like a lute string being pulled too tight, about to snap. The way her arm tore from her shoulder flesh, ripping like so many seams in a toga drew her from her thoughts. She knew in that final, excruciatingly slow loss of consciousness that she had been wrong. She knew she had succumbed to the folly of hubris, she had thought herself too wise. Confident that she had understood so much. In that moment of realization she knew she had been wrong. Aristotle, Plato, they had been wrong. Men are evil.',

          title: 'Novella',
          story: 'Here is the intro I am working on... would love feedback!  The taxi driver was quiet and somber as he sped down the gravel road heading west towards the farm I would be staying at for the next few weeks. The air was fresh and frigid, carrying the scents of grass and the sea. I stared out at the shimmering blue expanse, looking for signs of whales or any birds that might be overhead, but I saw none. None but the white-tipped swells of the ocean. To my right there were grasslands. Tufts of brown-beige grass poking up between tufts of shorter emerald mounds that grounded the stalks as they were tossed wildly in the winds of the sea. The driver had the heat turned all the way up. Blasting hot air into the small red car that carried us down the roadway. The man in the front seat had a serious face, with patchy gray stubble that dappled his chin and icy blue eyes that watched me and the road in a series of suspicious furtive glances.  You want to go to the Hjalmarsen farm? It was the seventh time he had asked, I could tell when he was about to ask because his face puckered and soured several times before he would ask. I nodded once again. I do. I am using the farmstead as a base of operation to study the northwestern coast. I will be researching grasses and mammals in the area. He quieted again as the car crested over a far hill, I could see his face souring again and I decided I would try to deviate from the line of questioning. Do you know the Hijalmarsens? He shook his head - almost too quickly, before the car lurched forward with a burst of speed. Story is they are witches. They always have the best crops come summer, regardless of the rain, or sleet the area sees. Their plants are always beautiful and blooming. Its very eerie.  Perhaps they have excellent soil there and work hard. I thought wryly as I smiled at him, of course that is just a rumor right? He shrugged as he took a sharp right. I was thankful for my seatbelt as I would have slid across the backseat if I hadn’t been. I glanced at the speedometer; it read 100km/h which meant we were barreling down this dirt road at about 60mph. I watched as those tufts of grass went rushing by trying to calm myself as I clutched at the door. In the distance I could see a large stone house with a grassy green roof. A turf-house. I didn’t realize they still made those.',
